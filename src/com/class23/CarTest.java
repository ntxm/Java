		// ; - end of statement
		
		//Constructor - special method/block of code that is 
		//being executed when we create an Object/an Instance
		//of the class
		
		//How can we create a Constructor:
		//1. It should have exact mane as your class name
		//2. It cannot have return type, not even void
		
		//How constructor is executed:
		//Every time when we create an object, we call a constructor and entire block of code 
		//inside  the constructor will be executed first
		
		//If we do not create any constructor --> compiler will create 1 default constructor
		
		//Why do we need a constructor? 
		//Constructor initialize OBJECT
